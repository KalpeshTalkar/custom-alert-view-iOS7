custom-alert-view-iOS7
======================

Demonstrates how to create a small presented view that hovers in front of the interface like a UIAlertView in iOS 7 and iOS 8.

Originally created in association with this tutorial article: <http://radar.oreilly.com/2014/01/transcending-uialertview-on-ios-7.html>

Now updated for iOS 8. The iOS 8 architecture for customizing presented view controllers is very greatly changed, and the project has been reorganized accordingly. It is therefore now iOS 8 _only_. For the earlier iOS 7 version, checkout commit 7410850.
