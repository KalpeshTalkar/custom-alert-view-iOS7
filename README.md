custom-alert-view-iOS7
======================

Demonstrates how to create a small presented view that hovers in front of the interface like a UIAlertView in iOS 7 and iOS 8.

Originally created in association with this tutorial article: <http://radar.oreilly.com/2014/01/transcending-uialertview-on-ios-7.html>

Now updated for iOS 8 and later. The iOS 8 architecture for customizing presented view controllers is very greatly changed from iOS 7, and the project has been reorganized accordingly. It is therefore now iOS 8 and later _only_. For the earlier iOS 7 version, checkout commit 7410850.

Now updated (in a branch) to Swift 3 (Xcode 8 Seed 3).
